# Synopsis
This document is a time series analysis of the Data using R to help answer the questions below:  

1) Are there some products and product groups where a certain type of marketing can be seen to work?  

2) Are there some products and product groups where it is impossible to see any marketing effect?  

3) Does seasonality need to be considered?  

4) Does trend over time need to be considered?  

5) Can the effect of marketing only be seen in the month during which the marketing occurred, or is there a follow on effect where marketing influences sales in subsequent months?  

6) Are there products where the data is just insufficient to draw any conclusions?  

### First Two Rows of Data:
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
ProductSales <- read.csv("new_clean_data.csv")
# head(ProductSales, 2)
```

### Data Categories:  
```{r}
names(ProductSales)
```

### Product Categories:  
```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
categorynames <- unique(ProductSales$category_name)
categorynames
```

### Product Subcategories:  
```{r, echo=F, eval=F}
subcategorynames <- unique(ProductSales$subcategory_name)
subcategorynames
```

### Time Series of Promotion Type:  
```{r}
promotiontype <- unique(ProductSales$promotion_type)
promotiontype
```

```{r}
promotionPlot <- function(promotionType){
promotion <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$promotion_type==promotionType)
promotionTS <- ts(promotion, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
}

ispPlot <- promotionPlot("In-Store Promotion")
plot.ts(ispPlot[1:10000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="Time Series of In-Store Promotion")
cpPlot <- promotionPlot("Catalogue Promotion")
plot.ts(cpPlot[1:10000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="Time Series of Catalogue Promotion")
npPlot <- promotionPlot("no_promotion")
plot.ts(npPlot[1:10000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="Time Series of No Promotion")
```

```{r}
isPromotion <- function(yesno){
promotion2 <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$promotion==yesno)
promotion2TS <- ts(promotion2, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
}

yPlot <- isPromotion("Yes")
plot.ts(yPlot[1:20000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="Yes Promotion Occurring")
nPlot <- isPromotion("No")
plot.ts(nPlot[1:20000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="No Promotion Occurring")
```

#### Sales Unit Analysis:  
```{r}
SalesUnitTS <- ts(ProductSales$sales_unit, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
plot.ts(SalesUnitTS[1:100], col="blue", ylab="Sales Unit", main="Sales Unit Plot")
```

### Time Series of Products:  
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Plot Creation Function:
obTimeSeries <- function(subcategory) {
subcategory1 <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$subcategory_name==subcategory)
subcategory1TS <- ts(subcategory1, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
}
```

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
prd1Plot <- obTimeSeries("Face Treatment Other")
prd2Plot <- obTimeSeries("Foundation")
prd3Plot <- obTimeSeries("Bronzer")
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
plot.ts(prd1Plot[1:24], col="green", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Time Series")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2010,1:24,1))
axis(1, at=1:24, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot.ts(prd2Plot[1:24], col="green", ylab="Sales", main="Product 2 - Time Series")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2010,1:24,1))
axis(1, at=1:24, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot.ts(prd3Plot[1:24], col="green", ylab="Sales", main="Product 3 - Time Series")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2010,1:24,1))
axis(1, at=1:24, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)
```

### Combining Promotion & Product Time Series
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
plot.ts(ispPlot[1:10000], col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="In-Store Promotion / Product 1")
par(new=T)
plot.ts(prd1Plot[1:10000], col="green", ylab=" ", xlab=" ")
par(new=F)

plot.ts(ispPlot[1:10000], yaxt='n', col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="In-Store Promotion / Product 2")
par(new=T)
plot.ts(prd2Plot[1:10000], col="green", ylab=" ", xlab=" ")
par(new=F)

plot.ts(ispPlot[1:10000], yaxt='n', col="blue", ylab="Sales", main="In-Store Promotion / Product 3")
par(new=T)
plot.ts(prd3Plot[1:10000], col="green", ylab=" ", xlab=" ")
par(new=F)
```

### Time Series Examination:  
```{r, message=F, warning=F}
StrPlot <- function(subcategory){
subcategory2 <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$subcategory_name==subcategory)
subcategory2TS <- ts(subcategory2, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
x <- decompose(subcategory2TS)
}

adjPlot <- function(subcategory){
subcategory2 <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$subcategory_name==subcategory)
subcategory2TS <- ts(subcategory2, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
x <- decompose(subcategory2TS)
subcategory2TSADJ <- subcategory2TS[1:24] - x$seasonal[1:24]
}

forecastPlot <- function(subcategory){
subcategory2 <- subset(ProductSales, ProductSales$subcategory_name==subcategory)
subcategory2TS <- ts(subcategory2, frequency=12, start=c(2010, 1))
subcategory2Forecasts <- HoltWinters(subcategory2TS[1:96], beta=F, gamma=F)
}
```

```{r, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
prd1SeaPlot <- StrPlot("Foundation")
prd1TrPlot <- StrPlot("Foundation")
prd1RdPlot <- StrPlot("Foundation")
prd1AdjPlot <- adjPlot("Foundation")
prd1FCPlot <- forecastPlot("Foundation")
```

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
plot(prd1SeaPlot$seasonal[1:24], type="line", col="orange", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Seasonal Plot")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2008,1:12,1))
axis(1, at=1:12, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot(prd1TrPlot$trend[1:24], type="line", col="orange", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Trend Plot")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2008,1:12,1))
axis(1, at=1:12, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot(prd1RdPlot$random[1:24], type="line", col="orange", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Random Plot")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2008,1:12,1))
axis(1, at=1:12, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot(prd1AdjPlot, type="line", col="orange", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Seasonally Adjusted")
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2008,1:12,1))
axis(1, at=1:12, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

plot(prd1FCPlot, col="orange", ylab="Sales", main="Product 1 - Forecasts")
print(paste("Forecast error rate = ", prd1FCPlot$SSE, "."))
monthNames <- months(ISOdate(2008,1:12,1))
axis(1, at=1:12, col="lightblue", labels=monthNames, las=2)

# Conclusions
#### 1) Are there some products and product groups where a certain type of marketing can be seen to work?  
  a. Conclusion: When beginning the analysis of the products, seasonal and overall trends are apparent.  

  b. Analysis of "No" promotion trends shows a match with overall trends. Therefore, when there are no promtions no affect on sales is observed.  

  c. Analysis of In-Store, Catalogue, and "Yes" promotion trends show an affect on sales, over time, very similiar to the analysis of All Subcategory types together.  

  d. The relationships of promotions with individual products requires individual Time Series, Seasonal, Trend, and Forecast analysis of individual products.  

#### 2) Are there some products and product groups where it is impossible to see any marketing effect?  
  a. Conclusion: Determining this requires individual analysis of all the product categories.  

#### 3) Does seasonality need to be considered?  
  a. Conclusion: Yes. Determination of seasonal Marketing strategies are only possible via observing seasonal trends.  

#### 4) Does trend over time need to be considered?  
  a. Conclusion: Yes. Determining the overall effectiveness of Marketing campaigns on specific products, is only possible via observing the sales trend of the product.  

#### 5) Can the effect of marketing only be seen in the month during which the marketing occurred, or is there a follow on effect where marketing influences sales in subsequent months?  
  a. Conclusion: At this time the effect of promotion campaigns appear to work in real-time, without any residual effect. A possible residual effect is found in the overall sales trend for all products.  

#### 6) Are there products where the data is just insufficient to draw any conclusions?  
  a. Conclusion: All products observed at this time seem to have varying sales with seasons, In-Store promotions, Catalogue promotions, and "Yes" promotions.
